## How to Run 

1. Please copy and paste the absolute path of where your `airline_safety.csv` is located as the
value of the `path` field within `AirlineData.java` file. 
2. Run `HelloApplication.java` - This will first output the barchart from part 3 and then after closing out
of the graph, view `XMLConverter.java` for the converted XML for part 1 and `XMLStatWriter.java` for part 2.

*** Note - If you want to run only parts 1 and 2, you can run the main function in `AirlineData.java`
